# venison.nvim

~~I'm not sure if deer are classified as game animals, but I'm going to pretend they are.~~

A plugin framework for creating basic games in neovim, based on a simple event loop.

NOTE: STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT YET READY FOR USE

## Roadmap
- [x] Open and close a window and register commands to that window
- [x] Save some window state between opening and closing
- [] Basic logging to replace some asserts
- [] Populate game window with characters and handle explicit content modifications
- [] Create a good api for handling key presses
- [] Make a non-blocking game event loop
