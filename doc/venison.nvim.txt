~I’m not sure if deer are classified as game animals, but let’s pretend
they are.~

An experimental plugin framework for creating games in neovim, based on a
simple event loop. Inspired by ThePrimeagen/vim-with-me
<https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-with-me>, but with a focus on a simpler,
more intuitive API, and making use of some pre-built, much more powerful
libraries. Also, you shouldn’t need to use a separate language to code the
game.

NOTE: STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT YET READY FOR USE


ROADMAP                                    *venison.nvim-venison.nvim-roadmap*

- Open and close a window and register commands to that window
- Save some window state between opening and closing
- Basic logging to replace breaking asserts
- Populate game window with characters and handle explicit content modifications
- Create a good api for handling key presses
- Make a non-blocking game event loop


KNOWN BUGS                              *venison.nvim-venison.nvim-known-bugs*

- The window cannot correctly handle applying a text change to the buffer which starts from a negative column number


CONTRIBUTING                          *venison.nvim-venison.nvim-contributing*

All contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or pull
request. Note that I have the programming capabilities of a small rodent, as
will be evident from the codebase, so please don’t be afraid to suggest
changes or improvements to the API.
